# Constructing Numbers in a purely set theoretic way

## Natural Numbers

We have constructed the Natural numbers using the recursive definition of what numbers are. For example - in set theory - we think of $\mathbb{N}$ to be set such that $ 0 = \{ \} = \emptyset \in \mathbb{N}$ and it is closed under the successor function, i.t if $n \in \mathbb{N}$ then so does $S(n) \in \mathbb{N}$ where $S$ is a successor function - you can essentially think of it as $n + 1 \in \mathbb{N}$.
